# Multisignature Wallets: An Introduction

Welcome to the Multisignature Wallet course! In this section, we'll explore the fundamentals of Multisignature (Multisig) wallets and their significance in the Web3 ecosystem.

## What is a Multisignature Wallet?

A Multisignature Wallet is a smart contract designed to enhance security and control by requiring multiple private key signatures to authorize a transaction. This feature makes Multisig wallets an ideal choice for shared accounts or organizations where multiple parties need to collectively manage funds.

### Key Components:

- **Owners:** Ethereum addresses that possess the authority to approve transactions.
- **Confirmations:** The number of approvals required to execute a transaction.
- **Transactions:** Operations initiated by wallet owners.

Now, let's test your understanding with a multiple-choice assignment:
