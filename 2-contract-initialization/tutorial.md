# Contract Structure and Initialization

## Section 2: Contract Structure and Initialization

### Overview
In this section, learners will explore the structure of the Multisig smart contract, understand the roles of owners and confirmations, and initialize a Multisig wallet.

### Key Concepts

#### Owners and Roles
- Owners are Ethereum addresses authorized to approve transactions.
- Each owner has a unique role in the decision-making process.

#### Confirmations Required
- The `numConfirmationsRequired` parameter determines the number of approvals needed to execute a transaction.
- Balancing security with flexibility in transaction approvals.

#### Initialization
- Deploying the Multisig contract with a specified number of owners and required confirmations.
- Ensuring uniqueness and validity of owner addresses.

### Task: Deploy a Multisig Wallet

#### Objective
Deploy a Multisig contract with three owners and require two confirmations for transaction execution.

#### Steps
1. Use Remix or your preferred development environment to deploy the Multisig contract.
2. Initialize the contract with three Ethereum addresses as owners.
3. Set `numConfirmationsRequired` to 2.
4. Verify that the contract has been deployed successfully.

#### Hints
- Use the constructor function to initialize the contract with the required parameters.
- Ensure that the owner addresses are valid and unique.
- Use Remix's deployment feature to interact with the contract.
