# Section 5: Executing Transactions

## Overview

In this section, learners will gain insight into the execution process of transactions within the Multisig wallet. Understanding the conditions that must be met before executing a transaction is essential. We'll explore the relevant contract code, explain how it works, and clarify the key concepts for executing transactions in a Multisig setup.

## Contract Code Explanation

### The `executeTransaction` Function

The `executeTransaction` function (Line 86) is responsible for executing transactions once the required number of confirmations is met. Let's break down its key components:

- **onlyOwner:** This modifier ensures that only owners can execute transactions.   
- **txExists:** This modifier ensures that the transaction exists.
- **notExecuted:** This modifier ensures that the transaction has not been executed.
- **transaction.numConfirmations >= numConfirmationsRequired:** This condition ensures that the required number of confirmations has been met before executing the transaction.
- **transaction.executed = true:** This line marks the transaction as executed to prevent re-entrancy attacks and multiple executions.


### Assignment: Execute a Transaction

#### Objective
Execute a previously confirmed transaction.

#### Steps
### Assignment: Create, Confirm, and Execute a Transaction

#### Objective
Create a transaction, confirm it, and then execute it.

#### Steps
1. Use Remix or your preferred development environment to interact with the deployed Multisig contract.
2. Create a new transaction to address '0xABC' with a value of 4 Ether and include any data.
3. Confirm the created transaction using the `confirmTransaction` function.
4. Once the required confirmations are reached, execute the transaction using the `executeTransaction` function.
5. Verify the emitted `ExecuteTransaction` event to confirm a successful execution.

This assignment reinforces your understanding of the entire transaction lifecycle in a Multisig setup. Ensure to check for the emitted events at each step to validate the success of the transaction creation, confirmation, and execution.
