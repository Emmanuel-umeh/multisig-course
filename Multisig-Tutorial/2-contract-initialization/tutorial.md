# Contract Structure and Initialization

## Section 2: Contract Structure and Initialization

## Section 2.1: Understanding the Code
### 2.1.1 SPDX License and Pragma Statement
Let's start our exploration of the Solidity code by examining the SPDX license and the pragma statement.

#### SPDX License Identifier:
The SPDX-License-Identifier (Line 1) is a standard way to declare the license under which the smart contract is released. In our case, it is MIT, indicating that the code is open source and can be freely used, modified, and distributed.

#### Pragma Statement:
The pragma statement (Line 2) defines the version of the Solidity compiler that should be used. In our contract, we specify that any compiler version equal to or greater than 0.8.20 and less than 0.9.0 should be used.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
```

This ensures compatibility and prevents potential issues that may arise from using incompatible compiler versions.

### 2.2 MultiSigWallet Contract Overview
Now, let's take a look at the MultiSigWallet contract itself (Line 4).

Our contract consists of events, state variables, modifiers, and functions that collectively create a multi-signature wallet. The events provide transparency by logging key activities on the blockchain, while modifiers ensure that only authorized users can execute certain functions.

In the upcoming sections, we will break down each component of the contract, starting with the constructor function, which initializes the wallet with a list of owners and the required number of confirmations.

### 2.3 Constructor Function
The constructor function (Line 14) is executed only once during the deployment of the contract. It initializes essential parameters, ensuring the contract starts with the correct configuration.
Let us break down the constructor function into smaller chunks and understand each part.

- The constructor takes two parameters: an array of owner addresses (_owners) and the number of confirmations required for a transaction (_numConfirmationsRequired).

- It includes several require statements to ensure that the inputs are valid. For example:

    - There must be at least one owner.
    - The number of required confirmations must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the number of owners.
- The constructor then initializes the contract state by:

    - Verifying the uniqueness of each owner.
    - Assigning ownership status to each owner.
    - Populating the owners array with the provided owner addresses.
- Finally, it sets the numConfirmationsRequired variable with the specified value.

### 2.4 State Variables
Let's recap the key state variables used in the contract:


- **owners:** (Line 5) An array containing the addresses of all owners.
- **isOwner:** Line 6) A mapping indicating whether an address is an owner.
- **numConfirmationsRequired:** Line 7) The number of confirmations required for a transaction.
  These variables play a crucial role in managing ownership, confirming transactions, and establishing the security rules of the multi-signature wallet.

In the upcoming sections, we will explore how these variables interact with the functions of the contract.


### Task: Deploy a Multisig Wallet

#### Objective
Deploy a Multisig contract with three owners and require two confirmations for transaction execution.

#### Steps
1. Use Remix or your preferred development environment to deploy the Multisig contract.
2. Initialize the contract with three Ethereum addresses as owners.
3. Set `numConfirmationsRequired` to 2.
4. Verify that the contract has been deployed successfully.

#### Hints
- Use the constructor function to initialize the contract with the required parameters.
- Ensure that the owner addresses are valid and unique.
- Use Remix's deployment feature to interact with the contract.
